# Fractal_tree
This is a canopy fractal tree simulation. The canopy fractal tree is created by spliting each canooy into two different others based on a minimum and maximum amount of branches. 

<h2> How to use </h2>
<p>
  You can tweak with the fractal tree generation by changing the minimum and maximum amount of branches. To regenerate the tree, just press the letter 'r'.

<br>
The example bellow shows the fractal tree generation based on the minimum amount of 50 branches and the maximum amount of 175 branches.
